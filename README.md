# Autonomous Driving Car Detection with YOLO ðŸš™

This project focuses on implementing an **object detection** system for autonomous driving using the powerful **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** model. The main goal is to build a car detection system that identifies cars in images captured by a camera mounted on the hood of a self-driving car.

## Project Architecture
1. **Data Labeling**:
   - `Bounding boxes` drawn around cars in the images.

2. **Model Loading**:
   - Pre-trained `YOLO model` loaded.

3. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - Preparing images for the model.

4. **Model Prediction**:
   -  Running the model to detect cars.

5. **Result Visualization**:
   - Drawing bounding boxes on detected cars.

## Key Features
- Implementation of the `YOLO object detection model`.
- Efficient `image preprocessing pipeline`.
- Accurate `car detection in real-time` images.
- Visualization of detection results with `bounding boxes`.

## Usage
- Download the pre trained model data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ozWxLf-JY6Qe6Ik6-KLVCOdayGipYj-T/view?usp=drive_link) and put it in the root directory.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed (TensorFlow, Keras, PIL, etc.).
- Load the pre-trained YOLO model.
- Preprocess input images.
- Run the YOLO model to detect cars.
- Visualize the results with bounding boxes drawn on detected cars.

## Results

The project successfully detects cars in images taken from a car-mounted camera. The detected cars are highlighted with bounding boxes, demonstrating the effectiveness of the YOLO model in real-time object detection.
